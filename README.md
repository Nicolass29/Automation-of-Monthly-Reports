# Automation-of-Monthly-Reports
This project automates data, report, and graph generation to analyze client performance in a fictional company. It creates random project data, including hours spent and amounts received, saving it in an Excel file. The data is consolidated by client, calculating totals and averages, and a graph is generated for quick analysis and decision-making.
